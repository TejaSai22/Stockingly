## üß™ Why a Virtual Environment?

A **virtual environment** was created for this project to:
- **Isolate dependencies**: Prevent conflicts with packages from other Python projects on your system.
- **Ensure reproducibility**: Everyone working on this project uses the same package versions.
- **Keep your system clean**: All project-specific packages are installed in the environment folder, not globally.

**How to use your own virtual environment:**
1. Create one (if you haven't):
   ```bash
   python -m venv fresh_env
   ```
2. Activate it:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     .\fresh_env\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On Mac/Linux:
     ```bash
     source fresh_env/bin/activate
     ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note on Virtual Environments

**Do NOT commit your virtual environment folder (e.g., `fresh_env/`, `stockingly_env/`) to the repository.**

- Virtual environments are system-specific, large, and not portable.
- They are intentionally excluded from the repository for best practices.
- To recreate the environment, use:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- Make sure your `.gitignore` includes:
  ```
  __pycache__/
  *.pyc
  fresh_env/
  stockingly_env/
  ```
